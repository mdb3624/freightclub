## Formal UI Requirements

| Category | Requirement | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Color palette** | Deep Space Navy `#0B1220`, Kinetic Blue `#2563EB`, Secondary Blue `#00D4FF`, Accent Teal `#00E5A8`, semantic success/warning/error | STYLE_GUIDE.md |
| **Typography** | SORA for headlines, INTER for body/UI/code | STYLE_GUIDE.md |
| **Icons** | Lucide-React only | STYLE_GUIDE.md |
| **Mobile-first** | High-glare, high-vibration design — oversized touch targets | HFD role |
| **Touch targets** | Minimum 44×44px (Apple/WCAG standard) | HFD role |
| **Cognitive load** | Hick's Law — group complex forms into sequential steps | HFD role |
| **Critical alerts** | Must override standard UI through visual hierarchy | HFD role |
| **ARIA** | HFD must deliver ARIA requirements + state-awareness logic to CODER | HFD role |
| **Shipper UX** | High-density data management, minimal clicks for repetitive entry | HFD role |
| **Operator UX** | Mobile-first, high-contrast, oversized targets | HFD role |

## Gap Analysis

### 1. Design Tokens — Critical

The Tailwind config only extends `primary` and `accent` color scales. The full STYLE_GUIDE palette is absent — components use hardcoded Tailwind utility classes (`slate-800`, `red-500`, `gray-200`) rather than semantic tokens.

| Missing Token | Intended Value | Where It Applies |
|---|---|---|
| `color-surface-dark` | `#0B1220` | Dashboard backgrounds |
| `color-kinetic-blue` | `#2563EB` | Primary actions (partially covered by `primary-500`) |
| `color-accent-teal` | `#00E5A8` | Success/profit badges (currently `green-100`) |
| `color-secondary-blue` | `#00D4FF` | Active/hover states |
| `semantic-success` | — | Status badges, banners |
| `semantic-warning` | — | Alert banners, amber states |
| `semantic-error` | — | Error banners, destructive actions |
| `semantic-info` | — | Info callouts |

**Risk:** Components built without semantic tokens are expensive to retheme and will diverge further as Phase 7b/8/9 UI work begins.

### 2. Touch Targets — High Priority (HFD Mandate)

`Button` default is `px-4 py-2` ≈ 24px height. WCAG 2.5.5 and HFD both require a 44px minimum for mobile/operator use. No responsive size variant exists.

| Component | Current Height | Required | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Button` (default) | ~24px | 44px | ❌ -20px |
| `Button` (within modals) | ~24px | 44px | ❌ -20px |
| Form inputs (`Input.tsx`) | ~36px | 44px | ⚠️ -8px |

---

### 3. ARIA Completeness — Medium Priority

| Missing Pattern | Affected Component(s) | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| `aria-live` regions | `Toaster.tsx`, notification bell | Toast/notification updates silent to screen readers |
| `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls` | Tab components (`LoadBoardTab`, `AvailabilityTab`) | Tab state invisible to assistive technology |
| Landmark roles (`<nav>`, `<main>`, skip-to-content link) | `AppShell.tsx` | Keyboard-only navigation incomplete |
| `aria-valuenow` / progress states | Load status progression UI | Status transitions not announced |

**Currently implemented correctly:** `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby` (dialogs), `aria-describedby` + `aria-invalid` (form inputs), `role="alert"` (error messages), focus rings on interactive elements.

---

### 4. Responsive Breakpoint Strategy — Not Defined

No `sm:` / `md:` / `lg:` extensions exist in `tailwind.config.ts`. No documented breakpoint contract between HFD and CODER.

- Modals use fixed `max-w-md` with no mobile overflow handling (exception: `IssueReportModal` uses `mx-4`)
- `LoadForm.tsx` (22KB) uses ad hoc grid breakpoints with no governing spec
- `LoadBoardTable` has no documented mobile collapse behavior

---

### 5. High-Contrast / Glare Resistance — Not Implemented

HFD explicitly requires high-contrast for operator mobile use in high-glare environments. No dark mode or high-contrast mode exists. Several text/background combinations likely fail WCAG AA:

| Pattern in Use | Issue |
|---|---|
| `text-gray-400` on `bg-white` | ~2.8:1 contrast ratio — fails WCAG AA (requires 4.5:1 for normal text) |
| `text-gray-500` on `bg-gray-50` | ~3.6:1 — fails for body text |
| Status badge `text-yellow-700` on `bg-yellow-100` | Marginal — needs audit |

---

### 6. HFD Design Coverage — Phase 7 Carrier Only

HFD has produced specs for US-701/702/703 (Carrier Profiles hub). No HFD specs exist for the following active or near-term surfaces:

| Surface | File | HFD Spec | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Load Board | `LoadBoardTable.tsx`, `LoadBoardTab.tsx` | None | ❌ No spec |
| Trucker Dashboard | `TruckerDashboard.tsx` | None | ❌ No spec |
| Shipper Dashboard | `ShipperDashboard.tsx` | None | ❌ No spec |
| Document upload / POD flow | `DocumentSection.tsx` | None | ❌ No spec (US-305 built without HFD) |
| Notification bell | App shell | None | ❌ No spec |
| Earnings / P&L (Phase 7b) | Not yet built | None | ❌ Required before Phase 7b coding starts |

---

## Compliance Summary

| Area | Status | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Color tokens in Tailwind | ❌ Partial — 4 of 6 STYLE_GUIDE colors missing | Critical |
| Typography (SORA/INTER) | ⚠️ Unverified — no font imports confirmed in config | High |
| Touch targets (44px min) | ❌ Below spec — Button ~24px | High |
| ARIA coverage | ⚠️ Partial — dialogs good, tabs/toasts/landmarks missing | Medium |
| Responsive breakpoints | ❌ No documented strategy in config | Medium |
| Glare/high-contrast mode | ❌ Not implemented | Medium |
| HFD specs for active phases | ⚠️ Phase 7 carrier features only | High (blocks Phase 7b UI) |

---

## Recommended Actions

| Priority | Action | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Extend `tailwind.config.ts` with full STYLE_GUIDE palette + semantic color aliases | CODER | ✅ COMPLETED |
| 2 | Add SORA + INTER font imports; add `fontFamily` to Tailwind config | CODER | ✅ COMPLETED |
| 3 | Define `Button` size variants (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) with `lg` ≥ 44px for mobile use | CODER | ✅ COMPLETED |
| 4 | Add `aria-live` to `Toaster.tsx`; add landmark roles to `AppShell.tsx` | CODER | ✅ COMPLETED |
| 5 | HFD to produce design spec for Trucker Dashboard, Shipper Dashboard, and Load Board before Phase 7b coding starts | HFD | ⏳ PENDING |
| 6 | Establish breakpoint contract in STYLE_GUIDE (`sm:640px`, `md:1024px`, `lg:1440px`) | HFD | ⏳ PENDING |
| 7 | Audit contrast ratios on gray text combinations; remediate failures | CODER | ✅ COMPLETED |
